# Telco AI Solution Labs

## Workshop Overview

The goal of this workshop is to provide you with a set of tasks to complete. Most of the tasks will require you to make decisions on how to implement the task successfully and often tasks can be completed correctly in more than one way, which is completely fine. A major goal of each task will be to summarize your approach as well as to outline alternate options as well as any tradeoffs.

It is important to note that for each task, you will be deciding how you want to implement it. You do not have to implement it what you think is the most correct way, and you should feel free to implement it in a way you have never done before. When we look at how you implemented the solution, we will not look at the correct solution but rather details on what you did, and if you learned anything or came up with insights into your approach compared to other approaches. We would however like you to focus on using Microsoft technologies as much as possible and realistic (but even that can be flexible if you can justify it 😊).

Many of the tasks may seem vague and that is on purpose. You are free to make assumptions as you need to.

Most of all, the goal is to have fun and try to learn something new!
